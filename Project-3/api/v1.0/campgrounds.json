There are 12 regular sites and two group sites.","electricalHookups":"0","fireStovePolicy":"Gas camp stoves are permitted. Wood, charcoal, or other solid fuel fires are prohibited at Coast Campground. Charcoal fires: The charcoal grills at Coast Campground were permanently removed on May 11, 2022. Charcoal fires are now prohibited. Beach fires: Permits are required for beach fires in the park and can be acquired at the Bear Valley Visitor Center. Small fires made out of natural driftwood are only permitted on sandy beaches (below the high tide line, if possible). Downed wood above the beach's vegetation line may not be gathered and burned. Put fires out with water, not sand. Visit https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/beachfires for more details. Fire bans: Visitors planning to cook food over a beach fire should come prepared with an alternative means (i.e., self-contained gas stove) of cooking in the event of a Spare the Air Alert or high, very high or extreme fire danger.","group":"2","horse":"14","image":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/structured_data/E5F43C80-9013-A688-5961320D21447B05.jpg","index":136,"internetInfo":"","latitude":"38.0171728059185","longitude":"-122.854375340707","name":"Coast Campground","numberOfSitesFirstComeFirstServe":"1","numberOfSitesReservable":"13","other":"0","parkCode":"pore","reservationUrl":"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/233359","rvAllowed":"0","rvInfo":"RVs and Trailers are prohibited.","rvMaxLength":"0","rvOnly":"0","tentOnly":"14","totalSites":"14","trailerAllowed":"0","trailerMaxLength":"0","walkBoatTo":"14","weatherOverview":"The moderating influence of the Pacific Ocean creates a climate with no great extremes of heat or cold.
